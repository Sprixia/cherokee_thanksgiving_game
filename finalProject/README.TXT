THE STORY
The Green Corn Ceremony is beginning for your tribe, and you are tasked with helping prepare for the feast. The women are collecting pumpkins and berries while the men hunt pigs and squirrels. Collect the powerups and avoid the monsters to improve your chances. Time and resources are limited, and if you don’t collect enough food you won’t be able to feed all of your guests!

HOW TO PLAY
Choose your character by typing in true for female or false for male.
Control your character using the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
All players start at 0 points with a timer of 2000 cycles. Points are gained and lost by collecting items. Men should collect animals and avoid food, while women should collect food and avoid animals. Everyone should collect powerups and avoid monsters.
If you reach 500 points before the timer runs out, you win! If your points drop below 0 or you don’t hit 500 points before the timer expires, you lose.

PLAYER
Upon starting the game, the player chooses their avatar. A prompt will ask you to enter either true or false. Type true to play a woman, and false to play a man. This allows them to customize their experience in two ways. It changes the appearance of their in-game character, as well as acting as affecting the mechanics ingame.

OBJECTS
The game world has the dimensions 900 x 350.
Pigs and squirrels are the game animals that men hunt. Pumpkins and berries are food objects that women collect. Throughout the game, monsters will periodically appear that need to be dodged. Power-ups will also periodically appear and should be collected if possible.

MOVEMENT
All non-player objects will move across the screen at their own rates. Powerups and monsters can turn randomly and bounce off walls.
Player movement is keyboard-controlled. Men can move up with the up arrow key or down with the down arrow key. Women have more control over their movement. They can move left, right, up, or down with the respective arrow keys. 
Touching a powerup (smiley face) will temporarily double your movement speed, and touching a monster (skull) will temporarily reduce it by half.

POINTS
Men will gain 50 points for a squirrel and 100 points for a pig, but lose 25 points for a berry and 50 points for a pumpkin.
Women will gain 50 points for a pumpkin and 25 points for a berry, but lose 30 points for a squirrel and 75 points for a pig.
Anyone who touches a monster (skull) will lose 100 points.
